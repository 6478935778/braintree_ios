/// The `Braintree` class is the front door to the Braintree SDK for iOS. It contains

/// You can choose: Drop-In or Custom.

/// With Drop-In, you can rely us to provide a fast, easy-to-use UI, which your users will
/// interact with in order to provide payment details. The result, from the programmer's
/// perspective, is a nonce. Send this nonce to your server to perform a variety of payment 
/// operations, such as creating a sale.
///
/// With custom, you have control of your UI, but errors will be handled on the
/// server-side via multiple server-side calls to Braintree. Like Drop-In, the end result is
/// a nonce, which you may transmit to your servers.
///
/// For advanced integrations, you should use BTClient, BTPayPalButton, BTDropInViewController, etc. directly.
