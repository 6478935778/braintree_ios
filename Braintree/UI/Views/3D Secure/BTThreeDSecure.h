///  3D Secure verification manager
///
///  3D Secure is a protocol that enables cardholders and issuers to add a layer of security
///  to e-commerce transactions via password entry at checkout. Upon successful authentication,
///  a liability shift may take effect.
///
///  There are technically two stages to 3D Secure, which this class abstracts:
///  1. Lookup - detrmine whether the card is enrolled in 3D Secure and how to proceed with authentication
///  2. Authenticate - a web-based user login
///
///  After initializing this class with a Braintree client and delegate, you may verify Braintree
///  payment methods via any of the three `verifyâ€¦` methods. You should choose the most appropriate
///  method signature based on your v.zero integration approach. During verification, the delegate
///  may receive a request to present a view controller, as well as a success and failure messages.
///
///  Your delegate must implement, at minimum:
///    * paymentMethodCreatior:didCreatePaymentMethod;
///    * paymentMethodCreatior:didFailWithError;
///    * paymentMethodCreatior:requestsPresentationOfViewController;
///    * paymentMethodCreatior:requestsDismissalOfViewController;
///
///  When verification succeeds, the original payment method nonce is consumed, and you will receive
///  a new payment method nonce, which points to the original payment method, as well as the 3D
///  Secure verification. Transactions created with this nonce will be 3D Secure, and benefit from the
///  appropraite liability shift.
///
///  When verification fails, the original payment method nonce is not consumed. While you may choose
///  to proceed with transaction creation, using the original payment method nonce, this transaction
///  will not receive any of the benefits of 3DS.
///
///  @note The user authentication view controller is not always necessary to achieve the liabilty
///  shift. In these cases, your delegate will immediately receive paymentMethodCreator:didCreatePaymentMethod:.
